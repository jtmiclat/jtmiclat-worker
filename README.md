# Security Headers Cloudflare Workers

Adds security header by using cloudflare workers. Ideal for cf pages.

## Usage

Copy `wrangler.example.toml` to `wrangler.toml` and fill in the `name`, `account_id`, and `route` fields.

Test it out by using [wrangler](https://github.com/cloudflare/wrangler2)
